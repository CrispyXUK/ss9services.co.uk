      <h2 class="h4">Early Career Summary</h2>
<p>Throughout my career, I have held various roles that refined both my design and technical skills. From 2009 to 2010, I worked as a Senior Designer at Solopress in Southend-on-Sea. In this role, I was responsible for designing a broad range of marketing literature including flyers, posters, brochures, business cards, and leaflets. I collaborated closely with nightclub promoters and DJs across the UK to create compelling promotional materials. Additionally, I maintained and installed computer, network, RIP, and printer systems. My role also involved assisting customers with their digital print and photocopying needs, utilising an array of photocopiers and digital printers, including colour laser and large-format plan printers.</p>

<p>From 2003 to 2006, I served as a Designer and Copy Assistant at Vertical Design & Print. My responsibilities included designing marketing materials such as flyers, posters, and brochures. I also developed proficiency in operating Mac systems, which were integral to my design work.</p>

<p>In 2002, I joined Falcon Press as a Mac Operator, performing lithographic print pre-press duties. This involved preparing artwork and outputting it from computers to film and plate making. I was also responsible for maintaining and installing essential computer, network, RIP, and printer systems.</p>

<p>Earlier in my career, from 1997 to 1999, I worked at Circle Services as a Mac Operator and Copy Assistant. My role encompassed litho print pre-press duties, including artwork preparation and outputting from computers to film and plate making. I provided support to customers with their digital print needs, working with Mac and RIP PC systems, Xerox Fiery RIP-based systems, and large-format photocopying systems. Additionally, I undertook small design projects, creating short-run business cards and letterheads for local businesses.</p>    </section>
